📊 Overview
Data Exploration: Understand the features, handle missing values, visualize key relationships.

Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, engineer new features (like FamilySize).

Modeling: Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Evaluation: Analyze model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and feature importance.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning (Classification models)

📈 Key Insights
Gender: Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.

Class: First-class passengers had better survival chances.

Age: Children had better survival odds compared to adults.

Family Size: Very small families or solo travelers had lower survival chances.
